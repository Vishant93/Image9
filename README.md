# Image9
Image9 is a full stack web application allowing a user to upload and download image files (similar to imgur). This application uploads/downloads images to and from a hosted AWS S3 bucket.

## Design Implementation
Front End: JavaScript and React Native for UI and Axios with webhooks to deal with http requests to back end http requests. Utilized VSCode for this portion.
Back End: Java and Spring Boot for REST API design along with connection to S3 Bucket. 

## Installation 
Because this application requires two web servers to run concurrently, several tools are needed.
